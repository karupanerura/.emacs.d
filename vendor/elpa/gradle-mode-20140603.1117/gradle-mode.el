  "Finds the closest project dir to execute the gradle command on.
This directory is found by checking up every directory from
'default-directory' for two files:
* 'build.gradle' -- default name for a gradle build file.
* 'some-folder.gradle' (assuming the file is located under
rootDir/some-folder/)
The latter is a common naming convention to rename the 'build.gradle'
to 'some-folder.gradle' assuming the file is located under
rootDir/some-folder/.  This is usually a convention for a
multi-project-build.
The directory to run the gradle command in is returned as the
directory that contains either of these two files.
As a side note, you can edit files in a sub-project and any command you
desire to run is run from the sub-project dir -- to run from the root
dir, you would have to move the default-directory value there somehow.
For example, switching to magit buffer, dired buffer on that folder
etc."
